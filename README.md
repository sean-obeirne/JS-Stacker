# JS-Stacker
JS-Stacker is a minimalist take on a popular arcade game Stacker, written in JavaScript.

For those who are not familiar, Stacker is an arcade game in which a number of squares bounce back and forth horrizontally across the screen as you attempt to stop them in such a way that they form one vertical tower to the top of the game board. In Stacker, the name of the game is reflexes. As the height of the stack increases, the pieces move across the screen faster and faster until you reach the top line. Once you reach the top line, at least in my experience, the game throws up a big middle finger at you and always seems to move after you press the button, even if you time it perfectly. It's *almost* as if the arcades don't want you to win the big prize for completing the stack, which is usually a current generation console or smartphone. I felt cheated the last time I played Stacker in and arcade, so I used that rage as inspiration for this project. Partially for the sake of validation, but also so I could practice for the next time I inevitably throw my 5 dollars away trying to win a Nintendo Switch.

JS-Stacker is definitely still in its infancy, and it could use some beautification and polish, but this was actually my first time using JavaScript for a project and I'm fairly happy with how it has turned out.
